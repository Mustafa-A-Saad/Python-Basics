In twilight's gentle, fading glow,
Where dreams and shadows softly grow.
A moonlit dance, a silver stream,
Whispers woven in starlight's gleam.

Through meadows bathed in soft moon's grace,
Nature's lullaby, a tranquil space.
The nightingale in branches high,
Sings tales of love, reaching the sky.

A symphony of midnight hues,
Paints the world in dreamy views.
Silent echoes in the breeze,
Caress the soul with sweet release.

Beneath the canopy of night,
Stars ignite, a cosmic light.
In quiet realms of slumber's wing,
Imagination takes its fling.

The quiet dance of shadows' play,
In the stillness, dreams hold sway.
A poet's heart, a muse's rhyme,
Capturing moments, frozen time.

The dawn awaits with gentle kiss,
Breaking night's enchanting bliss.
Yet in the echoes of the night,
A poet's pen continues its flight.
